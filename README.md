Dave's Chat App
==============================

A simple chat application using sockets to send messages between clients and the server.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Running with Docker Compose

The easiest way to start the application is using Docker Compose, which will automatically set up both the Node.js application and MongoDB database:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will:
- Start a MongoDB container on port 27017
- Build and start the chat application on port 3000
- Create a network for the containers to communicate

To run in detached mode (background):
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop the application:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

Once running, access the chat application at: `http://localhost:3000`
